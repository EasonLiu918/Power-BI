## 🚀 Key Insights  
- **Steady revenue growth** – 2018–2020 shows consistent YoY increase: a strong surge in 2019 vs 2018, followed by continued but slightly slower growth into 2020.  
- **Bikes dominate the portfolio** – – Bikes contribute around 63% of total revenue, while Accessories and Clothing make up the remaining share, indicating a bike-centric product mix..

## 🧭 Strategic Recommendations  
- **Deepen presence in core regions**: Maintain and expand distribution in North America and Europe, which together contribute more than 80% of revenue.  
- **Develop growth in Pacific markets**: Pacific shows smaller share but meaningful volume; targeted campaigns here could unlock incremental growth.  
- **Optimize product mix within Bikes & Accessories**: Since Bikes drive most revenue, focus on high-margin models and bundle them with Accessories to lift average order value.  
- **Plan around seasonality**: – Align promotions and inventory to the Q3–Q4 peak season, while using Q1–Q2 for clearance and customer acquisition campaigns.
